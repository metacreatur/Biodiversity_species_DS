For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

this project contains biodiversity.zip which contains two csv files: 
1)species_info.csv - contains data about different species and their conservation status.
  
  species_info.csv: columns of data
  
  category - class of animal
  scientific_name - the scientific name of each species
  common_name - the common names of each species
  conservation_status - each speciesâ€™ current conservation status

2)observations.csv - holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.
  
  observations.csv: columns of data
  
  scientific_name - the scientific name of each species
  park_name - Park where species were found
  observations - the number of times each species was observed at park

  
Project Tasks to do:
   -settingup jupyter notebook as directory and set up git repository include(jupyter notebook, csv files).
Project Scoping:
Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.
